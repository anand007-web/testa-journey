# Animation Assets

This directory contains Lottie animation JSON files for the quiz application.

To add new animations:
1. Download Lottie JSON files from sources like https://lottiefiles.com/
2. Name your animation file according to its purpose (e.g., success.json, confetti.json)
3. Place the JSON file in this directory

The following animations are recommended:
- success.json - Displays when a user answers correctly
- error.json - Displays when a user answers incorrectly
- loading.json - Shows during loading states
- confetti.json - Shows at the end of a successful quiz
- trophy.json - Shows at the end when a user scores highly

Note: If animation files are missing, the app will fall back to CSS animations.
